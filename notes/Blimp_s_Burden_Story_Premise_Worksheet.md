|Background                     |Barney is a mediocre software engineer at MapQuest by day and the Chief Supervisor of the Denver Virtual Air Route Traffic Control Center for the rest of his waking time. He made it through college and two years of industry successfully before his mother died in 2015. He cannot allow himself to grieve, so he buries himself in administrative tasks, stupid memes, energy drinks, and (particularly sterile) video games.|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|What choice must the hero make?|If Blimp chooses to accept and develop Pith's friendship, he will be able to confront his feelings of abandonment and learn to grieve through noise and nonsense. If he chooses to continue regarding Pith as an enemy, the only outcome for him will be jailtime - at best, a return to his old life - and Pith will take much longer to realize that he can still be nonsensical without being so cruel.                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

PREMISE

Tie all of the above together in a 2-sentence summary:

Barney Blimp is a mediocre software engineer who hides away from his grief of his mother's death in his online flight simming and sleep deprivation. Theodore Pith - his eccentric new boss with a penchant for nonsensical disruption - inadvertently forces him to acknowledge his distaste with his own lifestyle, but he must choose to befriend him
