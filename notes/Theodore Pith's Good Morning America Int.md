Theodore Pith's Good Morning America Interview [CHAPTER V]
JAKE JINGLES: Here with us in the studio this morning is Theodore Pith, author of his new, quite controversial but hot-selling book - especially here in New York, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Are Varieties of Cheese: How Your Foodism Will End Everything, and the new owner of the renamed Manhattan BBQ joints, Pith's Chili Trough and Pith's Chili Playpen. We've got what looks to be a... Ha ha, well... a miniature trough of chili right here in front of us. A lot to dive into, for sure, but first, Mr. Pith... Your book seems well, directly opposing what I see and smell in front of me. That is cheese on that chili, right?

Jake Jingles holds the obnoxiously-bound volume upright for the camera to see, but has his hand over the nude, cheese-covered woman drawn just beneath the title.

THEODORE PITH: Yes, that's an understandable contrast to make, Jack. First, I'd like to say how wonderful it is to be here above the beautiful Time Squared... Wow! You guys have a great audience. Hiya, folks! Love you guys! Don't be shy - get your hands dirty! It's Chili Day!

Pith waves dumbly at the crowd behind the camera, who cheer and whoop in response. The cameraman cuts to the cheering a bit obviously late.

JAKE JINGLES: Well, there it is... You've gotta love that humor! Was it part of promoting the book, buying these restaurants or was the timing just a coincidence?

JAIME JANGLES: And has the tour got you jetlagged, or was your shirt part of the promotion, too? What kind of a shirt is that?

THEODORE PITH: First of all, yes that is true, free-range American cheese grated into your chili, there... I'm actually going to start digging in, if you don't mind.

JAKE JINGLES: No, of course... I think I'll join right in with ya.

THEODORE PITH: I, myself, really don't find the book's argument in conflict with my love of chili, particularly.

JAKE JINGLES: That argument being - as I understand having read as much as I could last night - that our obsession with food is... Well, sortof rampant and infecting our culture-

THEODORE PITH: ...and stealing attention from important efforts in policy, charity, et cetera, yes, but when you do finish the book - and I really hope you do, George - you'll have been taken through my conclusion, which is, essentially, that it's our delicious, gluttonous, organic Rome's time to fall, if you get my drift.

JAIME JANGLES: I have to say... I haven't gotten to read the book yet, but I really love my me food - I happen to know that Jake, here, loves his even more, and it's hurtful - the suggestion that my interest in food is somehow malicious-

THEODORE PITH: ...oh James! Don't look so bashful! Please, eat your chili!

JAIME JANGLES: I'm Jaime, actually-

THEODORE PITH: ...oh shit, I'm so sorry! That's really embarrassing... Jaime, please let me make it up to you - have some of my chili!

Jake and Jaime cringe and trade sideways glances at the profanity. A trickle of gasps can be heard from the audience.

JAKE JINGLES: Hey, now! This is a live family show, Theo-

THEODORE PITH: ...gosh, I am so sorry guys. 

Pith looks into the camera, mouth, hands and shirt covered in brown. Weak applause and laughter comes from off screen.

THEODORE PITH: Kids, you should know that profanity is nothing by the byproduct of laziness. True eloquence is-

JAKE JINGLES: ...tell you what, let's just get back to the book, alright?

THEODORE PITH: Sure, sure... It's really exciting to see it finally going off the shelves after all these weeks, you know. Writing something like this is grueling stuff.

JAIME JANGLES: Wow, yes, I can't even imagine. How long did the process take, do you know?

THEODORE PITH: At least three... Yeah, three weeks or so, last November I think it was.

Jaime and Jake both wow.

JAKE JINGLES: That's actually... really no time at all... Really quick. It's nearly 500 pages, right? And this is your first book?

Jake stiffly began to manipulate the bright-orange volume again turning it over, very deliberately assuring that the cheese woman be excluded from the shot.

THEODORE PITH: First published book under my own name, ya know. I've written a few other things, here and there, but that's a subject for another time.

The studio audience awwws.

JAKE JINGLES: Sure, we'll have to have you back some time.

Jake smiles with visible grit.

JAKE JINGLES: But, this apocalypse... Is it happening now? Soon? A hundred years in the future? Or...?

THEODORE PITH: All three, really. We are here eating scrumptious, fifty-dollar chili while unprecedented numbers of people are starving, all over the world - in Haiti, Namibia, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Detroit... And yet we demand only the cleanest last few decimals of a percentage from the food on our own tables.

JAKE JINGLES: A striking thought.

THEODORE PITH: Quite. And that was the idea, but it's also important to note - not to give too much away, I hope - that Rome's decline is inevitable, despite what hope we all love to swaddle ourselves in, and thus we might as well enjoy what we have so far achieved, yes?

**JAIME JANGLES**: Well, I'm glad you brought this chili with you... It *is* quite an achievement.
