LILITH THARP
Born December 30th, 1995 - [The Day of Instructional Laconic Authority](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s36/nl/4017180/c444653c-9474-4339-a65f-32c7d0c298a8)
From Chicago, IL

Lily Tharp grew up in a fairly rich Chicago suburb with one younger brother and graduated with a BA in Economics from The University of Chicago. Her mother is a lawyer and her father is a (now-struggling) architect. She rode horses competitively up until her Freshman year of High School and still loves them quietly as someone acutely aware of the "Horse Girl" brand. In contrast with her parents' class, she loves the underground footwork scene and listens almost entirely to Rap and the Blues. She is extremely precocious in her ability to see across class in business, especially, and generally gifted with high, versatile intelligence, management savvy, and confidence in leadership. She very much understands efficiency and power and how, when, and why to use it.

Though confident professionally, she also has a high emotional intelligence which she tends to suppress, making her sometimes bitter and depressed, but also hilarious, emotionally responsible, and quite wise.

**At her best**, she is capable, pragmatic, and efficient.

**At her worst**, she is hypocritical, bossy, unforgiving, and shut down.

WHATEVER HAPPENS, LILY IS NOT AN OBJECT, and this can perhaps be best avoided by 1) insuring that she is not simply discussed through her function for Pith or any other man, 2) placing special emphasis on the consequences when she appears - because she is by far the most effective character in just about any relevant or measurable comparison. Of course, she must also be made into a real character with substance and contradictions and peculiarities, but never for the purpose of the whoa, look at how interesting she is trope.

From "[Arguments and Function](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s36/nl/4017180/9193944f-ba42-40fd-92d2-997ea2069737)":
Lily Tharp, however, is the opposite of all of these in her contentment to live as an emotionally functional and physically sober being. Her control is not absolute (nor does she desire it to be,) and so the intensity of her feeling is preserved "healthily." She is the infallible counter-argument but the reader should note that - even in her infallibility - something within her seeks to be around these extremes instead of her own kind (if they do indeed exist, it is not within this story save for in her case.) Like all of the characters, she wants to feel more than anything, and in her harmonious relationship with herself, she is able to enjoy the energy of the extremes. Without Pith, she would certainly not be incomplete, but she would be quite bored. (Of course, it's worth noting that without Tharp, Pith's entire empire and way of life would no doubt fall apart.) She is essential to the ultimate argument about feeling which is: the bravest way to live is to accept one's vulnerability and feel everything with one's whole being.

She is athletic and uniquely beautiful. I rely on the fact that Mariah actually exists with a certain visibility that will (hopefully) prevent me from descending into total cliche in Lily's creation.

Lily's gotta freeclimb. Or would she consider it ignorant? Perhaps her extraordinary comprehension of the risk actually enhances the thrill.

Pith secretly likes that people assume they are a couple, though she finds his entire person completely inviable, romantically, and her superiority in just about every facet of life confines their relationship to the best friend - maternal spectrum (and is also the only thing about her that irritates him.)

The only main character who regularly sleeps and eats in a somewhat healthy fashion.
