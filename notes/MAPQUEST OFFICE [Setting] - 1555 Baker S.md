MAPQUEST OFFICE [Setting] - 1555 Baker Street, Denver, CO
Via [Office Snaphots](https://officesnapshots.com/2013/12/11/inside-mapquests-denver-headquarters/). ([Backup](file:///C:/Users/David%20Blue/Documents/Pith/MapQuest%20Headquarters%202012/insidemapquestsdenverhq-officesnapshots.pdf))

> To celebrate its 15th anniversary, MapQuest asked [IA Interior Architects](http://interiorarchitects.com/) to oversee the relocation and design its new, 17,000-sq.-ft. headquarters in Denver. 
> 
> The space has a raw-yet-refined aesthetic that echoes MapQuest’s start-up roots and brand. Concrete floors, exposed ceilings, and extensive use of metal and glass are set against such branded elements as MapQuest’s purple, red, orange and green palette, as well as bold, enlarged maps of destinations ranging from Denver to Machu Picchu. 
> 
> An open plan disperses natural light and also fosters collaboration; in place of private offices, a dozen huddle rooms are available for private conversations. The City Park area is intended to be a gathering space for large presentations. It includes the café/break area, a variety of open seating areas, and is flexible to incorporate the adjacent boardroom through the use of sliding glass doors providing for large gatherings and open teaming. On a fast-paced schedule, the project was completed in just five months, from start to occupancy.

He plopped and slumped in his chair, but stared at the worn neon geometric shape in the carpet by his feet...
