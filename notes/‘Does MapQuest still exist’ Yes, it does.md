‘Does MapQuest still exist?’ Yes, it does, and it’s a profitable business. - The Washington Post [SETTING]
"Even now, some 40 million people — almost all of them in North America — use MapQuest at least once a month."

"Though MapQuest still has the second-highest share of the domestic market in online mapping, about 25 percent, it’s a minnow when it comes to resources. Google dispatches cars across the world to map it; MapQuest’s mapping detail is limited beyond North America. Nokia’s competing Here mapping system has 6,000 employees; MapQuest has 100."

"Unlike Nokia and Google, MapQuest doesn’t own the little bits of core data that create a digital map; it buys that information from a Dutch company, TomTom."

"In an earnings call last November [2015,] Tim Armstrong, AOL’s chief executive, called MapQuest a 'very strategic asset.'"

"One woman, for instance, said she worried about driving the wrong way down a one-way street, and MapQuest realized there was a better way to mark such roads. When the mobile app was introduced in late-2013, one-way streets were more easily identifiable, marked like the vanes of a bird feather."
