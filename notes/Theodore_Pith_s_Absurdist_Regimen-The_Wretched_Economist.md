One hastened February evening, twelve Wisconsin industry giants surrounded two sides of an oval dining table in the otherwise abandoned, musky ballroom of an ovalish novelty riverboat called Grand Belle with a fake prop sternpaddle which tumbled idly as she wandered the ovalest major lake in the continental United States - called Geneva - completely alone. Two decks above them in a port-a-potty-sized pilothouse, Captain Art Shakes was both suspiciously diligent - even when he supposed nobody was looking - and yet readily willing to admit his redundancy on a cold night guiding a slow leisure boat about an empty, unbroken lake. "As it stands, I could leave it, watch a whole Roseanne episode downstairs, and come back up to find everything more or less unchanged," he claimed, yet immediately refused my request to relieve him because it pays too well.

I was onboard amid jetlag of the deepest delirium and becoming rapidly less sure of my waking state with each passing second. I knew only two of those twelve: new and old money drywall royalty, Dimitri Model and Aaron Hunt with what looked like a severe disparity in the number of cards they each held, respectively, and - aside from their hosts - they were the youngest by a sure bet. The thing is, I couldn't for the life of me figure out why I knew so much about two Wisconsin drywallers and the exact moment and/or timetable of that research still eludes me, but so does the name of my very own mother sometimes, so the chronology of the whole thing is not what I'd swear by. Half-dreaming was as good 'a state as any to be in, though, when becoming first acquainted with my host-to-be for a whole year's shadow, and it remained even moreso when I fell over the railing and into the icy, suddenly much-less-docile-seeming Geneva, drunk. Theodore seemed to truly agree to the whole thing after fishing me out himself, if only because he realized my potential as plaything when I provided him a respite from what must be a grueling facade to maintain. His game, I would later observe, was to invite a selection of moderately powerful people to play Poker and attempt to conceal for hours from them the truth - he did not know the first thing about a deck of cards, but his green-eyed Bluff was more dimensional than any could ever guess.

Ultimately, games of his like these are a tell, themselves; they are but a part of the whole persona which Theodore Pith, the conundrum - the anti-billionaire billionaire - chooses to project to the rest of us. In short, my primary goal in spending an entire 52 weeks with him was to gather intelligence on the sincerity of this persona, to find out if it is indeed more than a projection; to find out - to the best of my ability - who Theodore Pith really is.
