Peter Built
The red-splotched white-faced Chief Technical Officer of MapQuest - an irrelevant company. What, exactly, does he do all day?

Receding hairline.

Married to Ingrid Desalvo.

He fantasizes about fishing, even though he's never fished and does not know a soul who ever has.

Eternally on his desk is a copy of his misogynistic memo (blatantly plagiarized from "[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s36/nl/4017180/9ab21072-e80c-4088-a14f-d66c62a38710),") which is partially included in the endnotes (ii).

Were Peter to act on this fantasy, Ingrid would have agreed to leave everything ninety-two minutes into his argument, but – ironically – the couple would’ve been pulled over ninety-two miles into their Northbound trip by a rare Wyoming State Trooper named Dennis Churd for doing ninety-two miles per hour, who would discover in running his license number that Peter was not legally allowed to drive in the State of Wyoming because of an accident with a Cheyenne school bus on a trip to see his college girlfriend before he thought he could afford auto insurance in 1992. He hadn’t shown up for his court date, but a rainstorm had crept into the far-Southern Wyoming sky in the wait, and booking the two would’ve meant missing The Big Game on his home television – scheduled in ninety-two minutes – for Dennis, so he would have briefly scolded them, making them well-aware of what he could do with Peter for driving twelve miles an hour over the speed limit on a suspended license (but certainly not of why he didn’t intend to) before doing nothing but suggest that they slow down. This would’ve further encouraged Peter’s faith in his stock of Driving Karma, which would nevertheless fail to provide any more confidence in his immunity for the rest of the trip, traveled firmly at or below the speed limit.
