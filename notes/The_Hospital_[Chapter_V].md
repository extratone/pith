# The Hospital [Chapter V]

`blimp`

Blimp is watching Good Morning America - a rerun from the previous week - in which Jake Jingles interviews Pith about his acquisition of a few BBQ joints in Manhattan, but Pith repeatedly redirects the discussion to his “plan” to buy Iowa, seceed, and begin a “grass-roots space program.” He is wearing a white t-shirt which says TODAY IS SATURDAY, MARCH 10TH even though the day of the interview was actually Tuesday, February 27th. It does however happen to be the morning of March 10th when Blimp wakes up. His horror is minimalized by the drugs he is on, but later in the afternoon - when a hospital psychiatrist stops by to give him the required examination to clear him to leave (which is incredibly redundant and ridiculous) - he expresses his anxiety and demands an explanation for the replaying Good Morning America episode. The psychiatrist (Dr. Bill Gravel) explains that Pith donated a hefty sum to [some children’s care program] with the singular precondition that this interview be played in this room for this patient at this time.

The Show

A cinematographic obsession with upbeat color - extreme saturation from both image processing and physical color selection in-studio, no doubt. An everpresent, 140 beat-per-minute electronic pseudodance beat in the background.

Moved to the clipboard room, and awoken from his dream about Lazarus' house.
