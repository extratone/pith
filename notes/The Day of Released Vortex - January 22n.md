The Day of Released Vortex - January 22nd, 1990
NATURAL 
EMOTIONAL 
EXCITING

HASTY 
EXPLOSIVE 
CARELESS

Those born on January 22 manifest a kind of charged energy that repels some people and draws others in. Expressive individuals, they may find it difficult to control their impulsiveness in either their private or public lives. One type of January 22 person presents a carefully controlled image in public, but lets it all hang out in private. Another type has difficulty keeping his/her wilder nature under control in professional life. The most successful (and longest-lived) individuals born on this day are those able to guide their impulsive natures cautiously through rough emotional waters in both the private and public sectors.

Emotional control is clearly a central issue for January 22 people. They must come to realize that they can be more effective in reaching others when their passion is tempered and allows people more room to breathe. Friends, lovers and family generally turn off when January 22 explosiveness threatens, viewing outbursts not as emotional richness but emotional disturbance.

In their professional lives, January 22 people do well to follow the most seasoned advice available to them and pursue the most measured and prudent course possible. There is no reason to fear that their work will lack vitality, creative fire or originality; it is attention to detail and the polishing of their skills that they must cultivate. They should not fear that advice will constrain them or somehow make them less their own person—the way they are built, this would be near impossible.

More highly evolved January 22 people develop patience and insight to match their depth of feeling. It can be initially painful, but the capacity to see themselves as they truly are, and consequently their work, too, is essential if they are to succeed in establishing meaningful relationships and lucrative business prospects. In addition, a never-ending improvement of social skills—cultivating interest in the work of others, listening to their opinions, sharing, discussing and appreciating their strengths and weaknesses, is invaluable. When such empathic qualities are combined with the hardiness of the January 22 nature, a truly formidable, well-rounded person emerges.

January 22 people do not handle depression well, so as soon as possible in their adult lives they should get to know themselves at a deep level and realistically assess their abilities. Pursuing one line of work with their undivided energies is usually best for them—building, growing, steadily and surely. Yet during this positive building phase one major emotional outburst can set them back enormously, so they must naturally guard against such a thing happening. The solution is not repression but finding a safety valve that lets off steam when their temperature begins to rise.
