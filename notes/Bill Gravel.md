Bill Gravel
Bill Gravel, resident psychiatrist at St. Nicholas Medical Center.
Says "at this point" a lot and always seems to be belching. (Inspiration: Mr. Earl, 4th grade science teacher.)Â Addicted to Vicodin and therefore consistently locked in an extremely drowsifying monotone.

"I don't mean to be frightening or anything. At this point, I'm simply here at the recommendation of a friend of yours. He said something is troubling you."

From [Psychiatry.org](https://www.psychiatry.org/residents-medical-students/medical-students/choosing-a-career-in-psychiatry):
"Upon graduating from medical students, doctors can elect to specialize in psychiatry through a 4+ year residency. Doctors spend the first year of residency training in a hospital taking care of patients with a wide range of medical illnesses. He or she then spends at least three additional years in psychiatry residency learning the diagnosis and treatment of mental health, gaining valuable skills in various forms of psychotherapy, and in the use of psychiatric medications and other treatments."
