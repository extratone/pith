Those born on December 30 can get their point across with very few words. Usually adherents to established traditions and methods, they put their faith in the tried and true. Extremely valuable people in running a business or organization, they dislike inefficiency and waste of all types. Also, December 30 people quickly recognize faults in systems and work methods, and are adept at eliminating, or at least minimizing them.

This does not mean that December 30 people are necessarily up-tight individuals or that they have problems relaxing. On the contrary, few enjoy a good meal or a fun evening with friends more than those born on this day. It is precisely because they have a great deal together at work that they can come home and freely express themselves. December 30 people are gracious and generous, but don’t cross them or oppose their right to rule! Indeed, most born on this day just have to be the boss—there is no other way. They must, however, beware of adopting a know-it-all attitude and dogmatically adhering to fixed principles, which can arouse great antagonism in others.

    Not surprisingly, many December 30 people themselves have serious problems with authority, not because they are rebellious per se but rather find those in charge to be incompetent or ineffective. They often begin to think about how they might be able to better run the show themselves. But a good point about December 30 people is that they generally think along constructive, not ego-satisfying, lines. For them the important thing is not power or domination, but that the best job possible be done.

    December 30 people hate mess and chaos. Often this leads them to adopt a more spartan existence, or at the very least to stow their possessions in another room and close the door. As they are not overly fastidious, they may choose to limit their accumulation of goods and thereby create less mess. Others may view this as evidence of their being tight with money. Most often this is not the case, for December 30 people know how to spend when they want or need to, even if it means going into the red. Their innate frugality, however, usually keeps them from wasting money and leads them to get the best deal possible.

Frustrations and worry can keep December 30 people awake at night. Upsetting situations do not sit very well with their usually taciturn personalities; what suits them best is to work their way out of a given problem. Unfortunately when met with difficult problems caused by another’s ignorance or blundering (as they see it), those born on this day can become extremely agitated. In order not to waste their own precious energy, December 30 people must learn acceptance of that which they cannot change, and the discipline to turn their thoughts to more constructive matters.
