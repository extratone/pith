Craig Footloaf
Barney's "slightly more fastidious" roommate who is obsessed with his own fitness, but fails to make any progress due to his habit of gullibly investing in local bullshit wellness schemes. Strong biceps, but narrow shoulders and imbalanced legs which make him top-heavy and terrible at most things. He loves nothing more than watching Curling on television, and talks about it constantly. To his distress, the only friends he's ever able to make are Tennis enthusiasts - to such a ludicrous extent that he is suspicious of everyone he meets in a social context. Since his adolescence, when both of his parents suddenly and inexplicably took up going to the court, Tennis has followed the poor man everywhere. Even after 18 months of cohabitation, he still regularly frets about the possibility that Blimp is actually watching matches in his room with headphones on through those late nights, but his inability to comprehend aviation (which is, mind you, not at all unreasonable) is in large part to blame. His "Tennis curse" is all he talks about when he gets drunk, to his friend group's eternal amusement.

Craig Footloaf, a 32-year-old man of fair Irishness with dense biceps attached in an unfortunate bottleneck to gangly, narrow shoulders and imbalanced legs, which made him top-heavy and terrible at most anything. He found himself obsessed with his own fitness, but failed to make any progress due to the rampant gullibility of his investments in local bullshit wellness schemes. He loved nothing more than watching curling on television, and talked about it constantly. To his distress, the only friends he has ever made have all universally turned out to be tennis enthusiasts. Such was the ludicrousness of the phenomena’s absoluteness that he was tirelessly suspicious of everyone he met in a social context. Since his adolescence – when both of his parents suddenly and inexplicably took up going to the court – the tennis menace had followed the poor fellow everywhere he went. Even after 18 months of cohabitation, he would still occasionally fret, unable to sleep over the possibility that Barney Blimp was actually watching matches in his room with headphones on through those late nights. His inability to comprehend aviation (which was, mind you, not at all unreasonable) was in large part to blame. His "tennis curse" had become the entire extent of his conversation when he was intoxicated, which amused his tyrannical tennis friends to no end.
