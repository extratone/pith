# Barry and Betty-Anne Blimp

`blimp`

Barney's parents are both 42 (with the same birthday,) rural midwest, and Lutheran.

Barry

Lives on his inherited family hog farm.

A Vietnam veteran.

A chipped canine.

"Crazy eyes."

Left the farm to Betty-Anne to launch a Lake of the Ozarks Helitour company in 1996.

Would go on to mount a campaign in response to NASA's prompt for suggested wake-up songs on the ISS that would lead to some 20 years of Elton John's Rocket Man, such was the absolute cruelty of his insanity.

Betty-Anne

The Fastest LibrarianÂ Who Ever Lived

Black curls turned gray, then white in a single year.

Died in 2010.
