# LENNY LATHER

`blimp`

A business reporter assigned by the Wretched Economist to shadow Pith for a year, by his request (as an alternative to being let go, or taking an unpaid leave after he made a huge error in an expose of Mark Zuckerberg,) if only to determine how the fuck any of his financial actions don't immediately bankrupt him. Both he and his editors assume that any possible story he could obtain would be 1) impossible to screw up and 2) amusing to an extent that it would be hard to make it appropriate for such a dry, respected business journal. In this way, he has set himself up to need Pith, to his bewilderment.

As the story progresses, Pith offers him the Editor position of The Quest - MapQuest's new  lifestyle blog under his tenure. Lather ends up sobering enough to write again, but - in his frustration with the way he feels the industry treated him during his greatest hours of need - he 'turns' into the completely ethically-compromised reporter who willingly gives and receives bribes for stories. At some point, he seeks revenge for the way Pith treated him but only ends up stirring disgust for being unoriginal in his desire for vengeance which will eventually (probably not in Burden) lead to Pith losing control of his resulting anger.

Addicted to dissociatives and hallucinogens (especially laudanum,) has dabbled in angel dust, dresses in terribly oversized suits.

Lenny Lather and his Laudable Laudanum.

Mark Zuckerberg:

"Nine months before," at an earlier point in Lenny's decline, he'd inadvertently made an enemy of his old friend from his time at NYU - Facebook's "Head-Emerging & High-Growth Markets Marketing" (your guess is as good as mine,) by snapping the neck of his Boston Terrier, Percy, after a misunderstanding at his family's Independence Day BBQ. Lather's reaction - no doubt - was the result of his smoking a Fry (PCP-dipped cigarette) under the porch just prior to the incident. Head-Emerging was by far his best contact at the company - and, by extension - the best of the whole Wretched Economist's, and he was an especially spiteful one - willing to get Lenny where it really hurt by continuing to masquerade as his confidante so that he could successfully sneak sour milk in his snout - distribute lies that would not hold up under the right sort of moderate scrutiny and eventually destroy his former friend's credibility. For the profile, Lather had spent a whole Winter talking to nearly 60 different people, trying to get the first dynamic picture of the depth and quality of Zuckerberg's sincerity. It was going to planned to warrant a special print edition and total almost 10,000 words.
