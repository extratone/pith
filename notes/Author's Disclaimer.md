Author's Disclaimer
All characters, places, and institutions depicted in this work of fiction are not real, nor - as far as the author knows - did any of the events actually transpire in the real world, in the same way that none of the people, places, and organizations in our lives are actually real, nor do any of the experiences we have actually happen, because nothing and nobody truly exists - including Mark Zuckerberg, who really sucks.

(The above disclaimer does not necessarily apply should a representative of one or more of the entities mentioned hereafter see fit to financially incentivize the author for the endorsement or promotion of their organization and/or service contained in the following work as the entirety of their mention(s) is(are) currently written.)

((Exceptions to the above exception could be made possible if the aforementioned financial incentive should exceed 100 [one-hundred] United States Dollars with reserved provisions by the author necessitating additional editions of the work and protecting this existing edition from recall, revision, wrath, extradition, public denouncement, or especially mean criticism.)) 

(((At this time, all above exceptions do not apply if said representative(s) are found to be in the employ of Facebook, Instagram, Oculus Rift, or any other property under the direct or indirect management of Mark Zuckerberg, who really sucks.)))
