The Simpleton Empath/Unknowingly Willing Victim.
Has been under suit for two years after ignoring several warnings to cease his constant retorrenting of the entirety of M*A*S*H*.
He hates being told his ideas are good when he knows they're not.

Blimp, the man who would save us? Nay! Blimp - the trespasser of humankind! He who would reduce us to Nothing, if given any power. But is his power in Nothing? How much power can there be, really, in Nothing? What if it is all of it!

Grew up with his mother in [Limon, Colorado](http://www.townoflimon.com/) after his father left everything to start a Helitour company in the Lake of the Ozarks in 1996.

so like... during this monologue, people are going to come out of the break room chatting and find this guy ranting. or like... get back from lunch and stuff. and Blimp is just sitting at his desk, zoinked out. but he ABSOLUTELY LOSES IT once Pith finishes and leaves. and starts like... jumping around on desks, eating random shit (including software DVDs and little staplers) and screaming. and afterwards he'll be rushed to the hospital to have his stomach pumped. he's going to get fired but then Pith is going to rehire him. like take [flash drives] out of his co-workers computers, note in the text the dialog that pops up saying "You neglected to eject the drive" as he's running over desks.

Has a "derelict" Honda CR-X.

Active as a [traditional gamer](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s36/nl/4017180/b7be8ad7-6477-42d8-bf6a-69370458f84f) age 12-25 (2000-2013.) Active as a simmer since age 19 (2007)

Barney's [father](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s36/nl/4017180/5e2b4f5b-a42e-40db-a624-0befd75d053e) was a yokel, through-and-through, and his mother was too fast for friendship with peers, but when the former lost his mind and left the two for his mid-life freakout in 1996, the 8-year-old, socially-uninterested Barney and his mother were inevitably left only with each other, so they formed a particularly strong bond. In high school, Barney entered a friendgroup of somewhat similarly-interested peers - three boys, two girls, ages (currently) 26-32 - who socialized him to an extent. They each had variations on the same issues being universally intelligent, uninterested in athletics for the most part, stoners, Pokemon (and other card game) -playing Smash Bros. enthusiasts with poor father situations (except for one of the girls, who has long carried on the assumption that Barney is in love with her, when he is, in fact, probably asexual.) Their issues have left them relatively jaded, but Barney's mother's death (2010) has gradually worn him to another plane, entirely. According to any of the original group, he is "not the same person," and "somewhat gone."

[The Limon 6](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s36/nl/4017180/2c535fb3-c7a3-4c2d-8a40-da608a432ba7) lived in a state of relative contempt of the realm of their upbringing throughout their 20s, but the five who "escaped" to contrasting environments have long since come to terms with rural culture, even to the point of finding the comfort of home in it (including Barney, despite no longer having a physical home in Limon after renting out the farm, which provided the funds for his "rig," and other hobbies.) Their fundamental grounding in working-class rural culture is one of the many aspects of Blimp and Pith that intersect, though the latter is/was a surrogate to it, and neither is particularly keen to reveal it to themselves or others.
