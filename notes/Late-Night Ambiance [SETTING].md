Late-Night Ambiance [SETTING]
That old heaviness - early-March mist that softens the yellow streetlamps so much so that your mind keeps assuming your eyes or eyelashes are wet. Earth eroded - slipping away from the hem of warping, stained fences. Sidewalks cracked, bent, randomly sloped, muddied, and generally laying in sorts of layering as if tossed about, but they are yours, entirely. The whole world, everything you can see - even when you can see quite a lot - it is all yours at the correct hour.
