Rule Britannia Lyrics
When Britain fi-i-irst, at heaven's command,

Aro-o-o-o-ose from out the a-a-a-zure main,

Arose, arose from out the azure main,

This was the charter, the charter of the land,

And guardian a-a-angels sang this strain:

Rule, Britannia!

Britannia, rule the waves

Britons never, never, never will be slaves.

Rule, Britannia!

Britannia, rule the waves.

Britons never, never, never will be slaves.

Still more maje-e-estic shalt thou rise,

More dre-e-e-e-eadful from each foreign stroke,

More dreadful, dreadful from each foreign stroke,

Loud blast above us, loud blast that tears the skies

Serves but to ro-o-o-ot thy native oak.

Rule, Britannia!

Britannia, rule the waves.

Britons never, never, never will be slaves.

Rule, Britannia!

Britannia, rule the waves.

Britons never, never, never will be slaves.
